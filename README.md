Full Stack Milestone Project 4 - Code Institute

The deployed site can be found at: https://jw-photography.herokuapp.com


# **JW Photography**

This is my fourth Milestone project of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module from Code Institute. This project was designed to demonstrate all the knowledge and skills I have developed throughout the Code Institute Fullstack Web Developer course. This project will pull together the HTMl, CSS, JavaScript and Python skills learnt in previous modules and add using Django3 to develop an e-commerce website.


## **Project Purpose**

This project pulls together all skills that have been learnt throughout the Code Institute course. The project is an e-commerce website that has the purpose of displaying products for the user to browse, add to a shopping cart and purchase. In addition to this are two custom models, in the blog section where users can add comments to a blog and in the contact page where users can send a message to the Superuser admin panel.

The primary purpose of this project is to allow a user to purchase photo products and navigate across the different pages within a visually appealing and user friendly website. The products displayed on the site are photos I have taken in various countries whilst travelling and provide a good range of photo categories  so as to appeal to a broad user base. 

This website  offers value to users as it provides a number of different style photos available to purchase and browse. There is also a blog section to learn more about the website owners and about certain photos.

## **UX**

It is clear to the user that the site is an e-commerce site when they land on the home page with the clear title and supporting text above the three current top rated photo products from the store. The user is able to view these products immediately or visit the gallery page for more options.

The user is able to peruse all available products in the gallery page, and can either  view all products as initially displayed, filter by price/rating/category, or select the specific geographic category of interest. This allows the user to narrow down their search to a particular type of product, making the page very user friendly and convenient. A user has the ability to register for an account , or login if one has been created. With an account in place, the user can then add items to a bag and proceed to checkout, with a profile page storing the data of these purchases.

Once a user is registered, they also have the ability to  send a message to the admin panel through the contact page, and to view the blog page where they can read, comment and like various blog posts, as long as they are logged in.

User types are split into the following categories:
* Visitor - Person on the website (either not registered with an account or not logged in)
* Registered User - Person on the website with an account (logged in)
* Admin - Owner of the website (logged in)

### **Colour Scheme**

I approached this project with a simple minimalist colour scheme in mind, as the main focus is to present photos that stand out for customers to purchase. The Navbar is a simple off white (#f8f9fa) background with black text and font awesome icons to stand out clearly. The shopping bag icon and product cost are highlighted in a light shade of blue (#17a2b8) to stand out both from the Navbar background and the background colour of the content.

The body background colour is a very light shade of blue (#c3d8e2) throughout, so as to not take focus from the products being sold, and so that all text and content is clear and easy to read.

As the photos are intended to be the key focus of colour on most pages, I opted to leave the headings as black to make them clear and legible.

The top row of the Footer uses the same grey colour as the Header to display the social media icons in a darker grey (#6f6f6f) to make them stand out. The text footer below then contrasts this by using the same dark grey colour as a background, but using the off white (#f8f9fa) as the icon colours.

Throughout the site blue is used as a colour to signify an option to edit/update, whilst red is associated with removing or deleting content. This way there is continuity throughout and helps ensure the website is user friendly.


### **Wireframes**

[Link to wireframes folder](https://github.com/JonWil91/milestone-4/tree/master/static/wireframes)

Hand drawn wireframes were used for this project. There were a couple of alterations from the wireframes that had not been anticipated at the start of development as they improved user experience. Examples such as improving the Product Purpose on the homepage so that the fact it is an e-commerce site for photo prints is immediately clear to visitors upon arrival.  Other alterations include using the space more effectively on the products detail page and having the navigation bar dropping down as a horizontal row instead of a vertical row on tablet and mobile devices.

## **Testing**

The majority of testing for this project was done manually, however online validators were used to check the code. These will be detailed below under ‘Code Validation’. Testing focused on ensuring that the User Stories are being adhered to, that the website is responsive across all desktop, tablet and mobile devices and that the development is following the guidance of the wireframes where appropriate.

Testing scripts have been written to test all user stories and ensure they work as intended. The attached test scripts are based on testing on a desktop as the steps sometimes vary for tablet & mobile, as indicated below.

Due to time constraints there was limited automated testing undertaken. In the event that another developer were to become involved with the app and make additions to the `models.py` file, tests were written for the forms of the blog and contact apps to ensure that only the selected fields would be displayed for user input. The following apps were tested to ensure that the return status code was equal to 200 upon loading: bag, blog, contact, home and products. This result in a total of 9 successful tests.

### **Bugs highlighted by testing**



*    On the checkout page, the registered user's address is saved to the profile regardless of whether the checkbox was saved
    *   To be fixed for a future release
*   The quantity selector on the bag page does not limit between 1 (min) and 99 (max) on any device other than mobile
    *   To be fixed for a future release
*   The pluralize function was not working on the blog details page for like/likes. A simple fix of a typo in the template
*   Not all links has the CSS cursor added on, fixed as an oversight
*   During development the category name for _snow_ themed products was amended from _ski_hill_ to _snow_ to be more inclusive. Upon testing it was discovered that this change had been applied to the local deployment, but not the remote deployment so the product geographical filter _snow _didn’t return any results . This was remedied by amending the category name in the admin panel of the remote deployment.
*   The date of a submitted contact message doesn’t display in the admin panel
    *   To be fixed for a future release


### **Code Validation**



*   I used the W3C HTML Validator tool to validate my HTML code. The W3C Validator tool doesn't recognise the Jinja templating, which resulted in it showing a lot of errors in relation to the Jinja code. This meant carefully going through such html files to ensure that they were formatted correctly.
*   I used the W3C CSS Validator tool to validate my CSS code.
*   I used the JSHint tool to validate my JavaScript syntax.
*   I used the Pep8 Online tool to validate my Python syntax. I had to update a number of blank spaces that had been missed. Unfortunately due to time constraints I was not able to fix all the E501 errors as I didn’t want to risk causing widespread issues before submission.

## **Compatibility**

To ensure that the website is accessible and runs across different devices and browsers, I have tested it on the following:



*   Chrome 
*   Safari 
*   Firefox - slight differences to certain CSS stylings but no change to functionality
*   Opera
*   Microsoft Edge


## **Deployment**

This project was developed using the GitPod IDE, committing to Git for every meaningful change and pushing commits to GitHub via the terminal Git commands. On GitHub I was able to view the Code Institute template recommended for GitPod use, clone it, and then create my own repository with the template. After this, it was possible to create a new workspace using GitPod.


### **Local Deployment**



*   In the terminal enter `git clone [https://github.com/jonwil91/milestone-4]` to make a clone of this repository. Alternatively, by clicking the green 'Clone or Download' you can download the file as a zip-file and upload it into your new workspace, please ensure that you unzip the file first.
*   In the terminal enter `cd milestone-4` (path to folder)
*   The next step is to create a ‘.env’, this will be an important file for safely storing your credentials. These can also be stored as GitPod environment variables if using the GitPod IDE.
*   In the terminal enter `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary dependencies
*   In the terminal enter `python3 manage.py migrate` to create the database schema
    *   After this stage you ought to notice a db.sqlite3 database file has been created
*   Enter `python3 manage.py runserver` to expose the app to port 8000. Products will not yet be displayed
*   The next two inputs have to be entered in this order in the terminal:
    *   `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
    *   `python3 manage.py loaddata products`
*   In the terminal enter `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin account to access Django’s admin panel
*   In the terminal, in the following order enter
    *   `git add .`
    *   `git commit -m "[Insert message for commit]"`
    *   `git push`
    *   This will push and safely store all changes to GitHub

At this point the local deployment is functional, bar the checkout feature using Stripe. To add this functionality, sign up for an account with [Stripe](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/www.stripe.com), collect the following variables to add to the ‘.env’ file



*   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = Value
*   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = Value
*   STRIPE_WH_KEY = Value

Please note that for testing the checkout feature using Stripe, the test card number is: 4242 4242 4242 (the CVC, expiry date and ZIP code can be any number)


### **Remote Deployment**

The deployed site can be found at: https://jw-photography.herokuapp.com



*   Ensure that you have Procfile created to tell Heroku the type of application using gunicorn and how to run it
*   Visit [Heroku](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/%5Bwww.heroku.com%5D(www.heroku.com)), register and create a new app
*   In the deploy tab set GitHub as deployment method and search for repository (you will have to sign into GitHub if you are a new user)
    *   Click enable automatic deploys to push to Heroku master when pushing to GitHub
    *   In Resources tab, in the search bar, look for Heroku Postgres and select Hobby Dev - Free - update to remote database
*   In the terminal enter `heroku login -i` and enter your credentials
*   In the terminal enter `heroku git:remote -a [name of Heroku app]`
*   Initialise a new commit
    *   `git add .`
    *   `git commit -m "[git commit message]"`
    *   `git push`
    *   `git push heroku master` if git push fails to push to Heroku automatically`
*   Create an AWS account, set up an S3 bucket, create a user and policy to authorise
    *   I selected London as the region which is written as ‘eu-west-2’ in the settings.py file which was created from the clone command
*   Using an email provider such as Gmail, set up a profile to access EMAIL_HOST_PASS and EMAIL_HOST_USER credentials
*   In Heroku settings, click Reveal Config Vars and add the following:
    *   AWS_ACCESS_KEY = Value
    *   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = Value
    *   DATABASE_URL = Value
    *   EMAIL_HOST_PASS = Value
    *   EMAIL_HOST_USER = Value
    *   SECRET_KEY = Value
    *   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = Value
    *   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = Value
    *   STRIPE_WH_KEY = Value
    *   USE_AWS = True
*   The above variables, with the exception of USE_AWS ought to be saved in the settings.py file in the following format: *`AWS_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY', '')`
*   To make final migrations, in the terminal enter:
    *   `python3 manage.py makemigrations - `Create the migrations (generate the `SQL` commands)
    *   `python3 manage.py migrate - `Run the migrations (execute the `SQL` commands)
*   Once the Heroku build is migrated and completed you can open the app
*   Additional objects can be added to the app through the admin panel, and media saved in the S3 bucket
